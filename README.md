# LaTeX Template Advanced

This repository has everything you need to build a large LaTeX document with a bibliography, figures, and a superstructure to scale the pages and sections beyond the needs of a smaller document.

Please start by replacing this README file with a description of your project and specify the filename of your LaTeX document in the Makefile. By default, the Makefile will first run `pdflatex` to render your document and will utilize `bibtex` to process the project bibliography and then it will delete any intermediate auxiliary or log files. Additional targets exist to give developers more granular control of the rendering and cleaning processes.

The functionality of the procedures described above and the documents detailed herein were verified in a WSL session for Debian running on a Windows 10 laptop. The Debian subsystem was running TeX Live 2020/Debian with pdflatex version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.21 and bibtex version 0.99d.
